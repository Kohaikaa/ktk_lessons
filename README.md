Sometimes I wanna murder myself and I can do nothing with that on my own but I don't want anyone to help me. I'm not gonna commit suicide anyway. Never. I promised myself. Although I try thinking about good, it doesn't help me a lot.

I have grown the skills and personality characters I need to become succeed. I have a big mission to complete. They have to live like they want to and be happy.

I kinda sorda dunno and at the same time I know what I have to do to reach my big goals.
