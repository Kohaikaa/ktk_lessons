Dear Vlad,

Sometimes I wanna murder myself and I can do nothing with that on my own but I don't want anyone to help me. I'm not gonna commit suicide anyway. Never. I promised myself. Although I try thinking about good, it doesn't help me a lot.

I have grown the skills and personality characters I need to become succeed. I have only one chance and one life, so I have to do my best.

I kinda sorda dunno and at the same time I know what I have to do to reach my big goals.

Best wishes,
Dark Thoughs.
